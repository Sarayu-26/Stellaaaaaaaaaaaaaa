## STEP 5: No merge conflicts!

```{r partner 1}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a plot of price vs. carat (or some other
### variables of your choice)
library(ggplot2)
data("diamonds")

ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=price, y=carat))+
         geom_point()+
         labs(title =" Price vs Carat", x = "Price of Diamond", y=" Carat")+
         theme_minimal()
       


```

```{r partner 2}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a subset based on filtering, e.g., 
### size greater than 1 carat or cut is "Ideal"

library(ggplot2)

# Filter the diamonds dataset where carat equals 1
diamonds_new <- diamonds |> 
  filter(carat >= 1)




```

## STEP 7: Uh oh, merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-1}
### Both partners - delete this comment, then write some code here
### to plot, summarize, calculate something simple using the diamonds
### dataset.


```

## STEP 11: And even more merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-2}
### Both partners - delete this comment, then write some code here
### to plot, summarize, calculate something simple using the diamonds
### dataset.


```
